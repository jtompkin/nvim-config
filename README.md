# nvim-config

Just your run-of-the-mill overcomplicated Neovim config. This config requires Neovim >= v0.12.0 (currently [nightly](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly)). It is made with Windows in mind, but will probaly work on Unixes as well; see my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jtompkin/dotfiles) repo for my Linux config that doesn't require nightly (good luck with that).

## Usage

Clone it into `~/.config/nvim` or wherever else you freaks keep your configs.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtompkin/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

If you are on Windows, keep in mind that many plugins expect a C compiler and othe Linux tools to be present. [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) is a good option.
